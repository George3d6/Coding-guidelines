## 1. Remove code, don't add code

"I hate code, and I want as little of it as possible in our product." â€“ Jack Diederich

1.1 Code is bad, unless you write it due to immediate benefits coming down the line it's going to be a liability not an asset, it's going to make
the project it's part of larger, and, as such, harder to maintain and modify.
